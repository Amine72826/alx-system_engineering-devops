Networking basics #0
Introduction
Welcome to the Networking basics #0 Project!
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental networking concepts.
Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this project will cover the OSI model, different types of networks, LAN and WAN networks, the Internet, MAC addresses, IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, IPv4 and IPv6, TCP/UDP ports, ping/ICMP, positional parameters, netstat, and ping.
By the end of this project, you'll have a solid foundation in network basics.

OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. These layers are organized in a way that allows different network protocols to work together effectively.

Types of Networks
There are several types of networks, including:

Personal Area Network (PAN)
Local Area Network (LAN)
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Wide Area Network (WAN)
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
Virtual Private Network (VPN)
This project will primarily focus on LAN and WAN networks.

LAN Network
LAN stands for Local Area Network. It is a network that connects devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or school. LANs are usually privately owned and provide high-speed data transfer rates.

WAN Network
WAN stands for Wide Area Network. It is a network that spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs together. The Internet is a prime example of a WAN.

Internet
The Internet is a global network of interconnected devices and servers that allows users to access and share information worldwide. It is the largest WAN in existence, connecting billions of devices.

MAC Address
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) of a device. It is a hardware-based address and is used for communication within a LAN.

IP Address
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network.

Private and Public Address
Private IP addresses are used within a LAN and are not routable over the internet. Public IP addresses, on the other hand, are globally unique and allow devices to communicate over the internet.

IPv4 and IPv6
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and uses 32-bit addresses. However, due to the growth of the internet, IPv4 addresses have become scarce. IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) was introduced to address this issue and uses 128-bit addresses, providing a vast number of available addresses.

Localhost
Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device. It is used to access the network services running on the same device.

TCP and UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental transport layer protocols used for data transmission over a network. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers unreliable, connectionless communication.

TCP/UDP Ports List
Ports are used to identify specific processes or services running on a device. TCP and UDP use port numbers to direct data to the appropriate application. There are well-known ports for commonly used services, and the range for port numbers is from 0 to 65535.

What is Ping/ICMP?
Ping is a utility used to test the reachability of a host on a network and measure the round-trip time for packets to travel from the source to the destination. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is the protocol used by Ping to send echo requests and receive echo replies.

Positional Parameters
Positional parameters are values passed to a script or command-line program in a specific order. They allow users to provide input to a script or program when executing it.

Netstat
Netstat is a command-line utility used to display various network-related information, such as active network connections, routing tables, and statistics.

Ping
Ping, as mentioned earlier, is a utility used to test network connectivity. By sending ICMP echo requests and receiving echo replies, Ping can assess the availability of a remote host.
